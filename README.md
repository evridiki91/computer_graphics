# computer_graphics for Bristol University module

1 Raytracer
• Light class created for creating and having multiple lights
• Soft shadows through area lights
• Anti Aliasing through super-sampling
• Phong Blinn shading model for diffuse and specular objects using Phong Class
• Reflections and Refractions (using frensels) with light bounces up to a specific depth. • Loading general models from external files
• Sphere primitives in conjunction with triangles

2 Rasterizer
• Parallelizable code
• Optimized line interpolation using Bresenham equation
• Anti aliasing through super-sampling
• Multiple lights functionality
• Phong Blinn shading model for diffuse and specular objects.
• Depth of field using averaging filter for objects away from certain depth
• Loading general models from external files
• Clipping using frustum approach. More advanced clipping implemented but not working properly
• Texture mapping from general image files
• Ability to move camera using mouse
